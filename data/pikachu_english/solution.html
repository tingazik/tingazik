    <li>Convert the hex data into binary.</li>
    <li>Construct an audio file with the sample rate as stated, 1 channel and 1 bit depth.</li>
    <li>Fit the binary data as samples of the audio file. In case you cannot set bit depth to 1, polarized values will also work. (e.g. <code>00</code> for <code>0</code> and <code>ff</code> for <code>1</code> in 8-bit depth.</li>
    <li>Duration of the audio should match the value as stated.</li>
    <li>Play the audio file, and you will hear the answer.</li>
